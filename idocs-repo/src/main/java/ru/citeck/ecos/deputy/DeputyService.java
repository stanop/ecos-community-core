/**
 * Extended interface for Java implementation of DeputyService.
 *  
 * Deputy Service employs Deputy Listeners (@see DeputyListener) to add custom behaviour 
 *  whenever events important for deputation occur.
 * These events can be result of activity of DeputyService or other services.
 * When it is DeputyService, it should call Deputy Listeners immediately.
 * When it is other services, some mechanism (listener) should call DeputyService listener method to activate DeputyListeners.
 * DeputyService should be abstract towards the implementation of listener of necessary events.
 * All that is important is that this listeners should call corresponding methods of DeputyService.
